## Spray And Wait Utiity Router
 Spray and Wait routing protocol termed as, Spray and Wait
with Utility (SnWU). As the name suggests, we wish to augment the classical SnW
with a notion of utility. In SnWU, the utility U(i, j) of a node i for any other node
j is given by the total number of times these two nodes came in contact. Similar to
SnW, in SnWU, too, a message is not replicated if its current number of copies is less
than two. Additionally, any node i replicates a message to another node j only if the
utility of the latter node, U(j, d), is greater than that of the former, U(i, d), where d
is the destination of the message, i = j = d.
